# M-M-1

> Simple M/M/1 and M/D/1 simulation 

- Queuing theory is the mathematics of
waiting lines
- It is extremely useful in predicting and
evaluating system performance.
- Queuing theory has been used for
operations research. Traditional queuing
theory problems refer to customers visiting
a store, analogous to requests arriving at a
device.

- The simplest queuing model is **M/M/1**
where both the arrival time and service
time are exponentially distributed.
- The **M/D/1** model has exponentially
distributed arrival times but fixed service
time
